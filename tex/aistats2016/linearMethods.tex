\section{LINEARIZATION METHODS}
So far we have assumed that we are given linearization parameters $\{\Linmat_n, \intcpt_n\}$ that allow us to 
approximate locally the nonlinear forward model given in Equation   \eqref{eq:linapprox}. As 
$\nonlin{\cdot}$  is a function of our latent functions approximation ${\Weights_n\feats_n}$,  
it makes sense to linearize around our current posterior estimates of these latent functions, 
$\hatlatentsn =\pWeights \feats_n$. In this section we describe two methods for linearizing 
the  forward model around these posterior estimates $hatlatentsn$ within our variational 
inference framework. The first method uses a Taylor series approximation and the second 
method uses the unscented transform We refer to the corresponding inference alg
