% MOVE TO RELATED WORK
%Most previous work in the \gp community has focused on addressing these challenges in 
%isolation. For example, with regards to scalability, the seminar work of \citet{quinonero2005unifying} allowed the 
%community to understand most sparse approximations in \gp models from a probabilistic perspective, 
% and the   framework of \citet{titsias2009variational} has become the  underpinning  machinery
% of most modern scalable approaches to \gp regression and classification. 
% With regards to multi-output and multi-task learning,  one of the most notable approaches has 
% been developed by  \citet{alvarez-lawrence-nips-08} using the convolution formalism. 
% Finally, concerning non-linear likelihoods, \citet{opper-arch-nc-2009} presented 
% the seemingly surprising (but powerful) result of estimating a full Gaussian posterior 
%efficiently for general \iid  likelihoods.
