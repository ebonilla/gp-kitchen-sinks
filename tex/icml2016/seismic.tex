\subsection{Seismic Inversion}

In this experiment we demonstrate the \eks and \uks performing a
one-dimensional seismic inversion. The goal is to infer both the geometry of
the interfaces between subsurface geological layers and the seismic propagation velocity
within each layer from noisy, interpreted surface observations of sound
reflection times, \Outs. We use two datasets for this experiment; a simulated
world with two randomly generated splines representing geological layers (providing a ground-truth), 
and a real seismic line from the Otway basin in South Australia (Pretty Hill
formation) providing reflection times for the four main layer formations.
Each dataset has 50 and 113 observations per layer respectively.

The inputs, $\Ins$, are the surface locations (metres) of the seismic sensors,
and we use the following forward model,
\begin{align}
    \latents_p^\text{depth} &= \max\cbrac{\latents_p^\text{depth, input},
        \latents_{p-1}^\text{depth}} \quad \forall p, \label{eq:clip} \\
    \nonlinf_p^\text{time} &=
    \begin{cases}
        2\frac{\latents_p^\text{depth} - \latents_{p-1}^\text{depth}}
        {\latents_p^\text{vel}} + \nonlinf_{p-1}^\text{time},
        & \text{if } p > 0 \\
        2\frac{\latents_0^\text{depth}}{\latents_0^\text{vel}},
        & \text{if } p = 0
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
Where there are $\otdim$ output tasks -- reflection times from each layer,
$\nonlinf_p^\text{time}$, and there are two types of latent input tasks;
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\latents_p^\text{depth}\!\brac{\Ins}$, the geological depth of layer
        $p$ corresponding to each surface location. Equation \eqref{eq:clip} 
        clips overlapping estimated (input) layers to create these valid
        layers.
    \item $\latents_p^\text{vel}\!\brac{\Ins}$, the velocity of layer $p$ 
        corresponding to each surface location.
\end{itemize}

Each of these input tasks corresponds to an output task, so we have also
indexed by $p$ instead of $q$. Naturally then $\ltdim = 2\otdim$, and the
problem is under-constrained since there is an infinite set of layer depths and
velocities that can generate the reflection times. To help constrain our
models, we put a prior on the average depth of each layer.

We compare against two baseline methods. The first baseline applies
gradient-free optimisation to identify the maximum a-posteriori latent tasks.
A GMRF prior is used to model the deviation of each layer from a flat mean
function.

The second baseline is a probabilistic approach using MCMC to sample from
the posterior distribution. For this implementation, the dimensionality of the 
inference problem has been reduced by parameterising the latent tasks as 
truncated cosine basis functions located on a regular grid, such that the MCMC
learns the distribution of their weights. We have used 20 parameters per
latent task, plus one observation noise variance parameter for each of the four 
observed taks. Independent Gaussian priors are placed on the basis weights, and 
a Gamma prior on each of the per-task observation variances.
